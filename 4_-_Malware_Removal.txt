Antivirus Rescue Disks:

It should also be noted the below list is presented in alphanumeric order without any intentions of implied preference.

Tools to remove other harmfull software:
========================================
Because of the history about Viruses, Add- & Spyware and Rootkits, some other harmful software besides viruses are nowadays (still) better handled by specialized Removal Tools (Software Vendors). So it's highly recommended, that you run on a infected system at least a Virus Scan and an Anti-Add- & Spyware-Scan!

Spybot – Search & Destroy
-------------------------
Safer-Networking's Spybot - Search & Destroy (S&D) is a spyware and adware removal program. S&D doesn't search in files (like an Antivirus Program) for signatures, instead it knows where spyware and adware place there files and removes them. S&D also repairs (what a AV Program normally don't do) the Registry and many other system configurations that can be affected by spyware and adware. Safer-Networking unfortunately don't have a download link for a finished CD/ISO - instead you have to create your own from within your S&D-Installation. Here is the documentation, how it works:

Adaware Rescue USB Key/CD
-------------------------
Adaware (as the name says) is by his history also specialized on Adware. Adaware is a good alternative to Safer-Networking's Spybot - Search & Destroy (S&D). The benefit on this Rescue USB Key/CD is, you don't have to create it by yourself!
Lavasoft, the maker of Adaware, had in the past a good name, but then lost a bit of his reputation because they used in a product the Komodia-Engine that made a big security hole in the installed system.

SUPERAntiSpyware
----------------
SUPERAntiSpyware from Support.com exist unfortunately also not as a Boot CD. Instead Support.com gives you the chance to download a Portable Version with the newest signatures that you can copy/burn to any medium and run it after that on the infected system.
Even when SUPERAntiSpyware is famous, it anyway received a "DISMAL" rating from PC Magazine, which complained that it had no real-time protection and the lowest detection rate and lowest score in a malware removal test.

MBAR Tool
---------
If you think your system is infected with a Rootkit, you maybe want to run Malwarebyte's Anti-Rootkit-Tool (MBAR). Malwarebyte also don't offer a Rescue System! Instead you have to install it on the infected system!
