TechBench
---------
The TechBench website may seem unassuming and maybe even shady, but it's actually home to a download link generator which generates links to various flavors of Windows that are downloaded directly from software-download.microsoft.com (See for yourself when you are given a download link!), so you don't need to worry about them being hacked and cracked versions that you might find floating around in torrents. With modern versions of Windows, always keeping an up-to-date version of your OS's install disk allows you the option to be able to reinstall your current OS without losing any licensing or even any data!
So the next time you decide trying your hand at gambling with Windows updates that land you sitting in front of a "Desktop Location is not available" error with no recovery options, no taskbar, no explorer, and no clue what to do, just CTRL+ALT+DELETE into the Task Manager, More details to make the File menu appear, File, Run new task, Browse. Keyboard shortcuts and right-click options apply here just like they do in the explorer and you can use it to back up what you need to before executing the disk's setup.exe to reinstall. It should also be noted when stuck in a situation like this, you may have to run everything with administrative privileges. Also, by default the Task Manager browser only views "program" file types, so don't forget to change that to "All files" in the bottom right drop-down. Backing your important data up should always be a precautionary step, but if your install disk is newer than your current OS build it will most likely be able to reinstall without losing anything similar to an upgrade. Slightly older install disks may also work, but the older they are the more likely they are to require data loss.
