Getting startet:
================
You need a _big_ USB-Key (Stick) for it, that shouldn't be to slow! (Maybe a USB-SSD-Drive ???)
To create a own Windows Boot CD, you need a second Stick to create it.
Some tool are no Boot CDs - so you maybe want to copy them on a third Stick.

And then you need YUMI...
